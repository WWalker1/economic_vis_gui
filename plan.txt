1. Implement the remaining economic functions (calculate_utility, calculate_cost, etc.).
2. Create a plotting module to visualize indifference curves and budget lines.
3. Develop the GUI using a library like PyQt or Tkinter:
   - Create input fields for utility function parameters, prices, and constraints.
   - Add radio buttons or dropdown to select constraint type (budget or utility).
   - Implement a "Calculate" button to trigger the optimization.
   - Display results (optimal quantities, utility/cost) in text fields.
   - Add a plotting area to show the indifference curve and budget line.
4. Write a main script to integrate all components and launch the GUI.
5. Test the application thoroughly with various inputs.
6. Add error handling and input validation.
7. Optimize performance if needed.
8. Document the code and create a user guide.
