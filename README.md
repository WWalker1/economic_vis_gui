# Cobb-Douglas Utility Optimizer

This project provides a tool for optimizing Cobb-Douglas utility functions under budget or utility constraints. It includes functionality for calculating optimal consumption bundles and visualizing indifference curves.

## Current Features

- Calculation of optimal consumption bundles for Cobb-Douglas utility functions
- Support for both budget and utility constraints
- Utility calculation for given quantities and parameters
- Visualization of indifference curves

## Implemented Functions

- `optimal_bundle`: Calculates the optimal consumption bundle
- `calculate_utility`: Computes utility for given quantities and parameters
- `plot_indifference_curves`: Visualizes indifference curves for specified utility levels

## Upcoming Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
- Budget line visualization
- Integration of optimization and visualization in the GUI
- Additional economic calculations (e.g., marginal rate of substitution)
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- User guide and documentation

## Getting Started
