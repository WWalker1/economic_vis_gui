# Cobb-Douglas Utility Optimizer

This project provides tools for optimizing and visualizing Cobb-Douglas utility functions, allowing users to perform cost minimization and utility maximization analyses.

## Current Features

- Core economic functions:
  - `optimal_bundle`: Calculate the optimal consumption bundle given constraints
  - `calculate_utility`: Compute utility for given quantities of goods
- Visualization:
  - `plot_indifference_curves`: Plot multiple indifference curves for a Cobb-Douglas utility function

## Upcoming Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction
- Additional economic functions:
  - Calculate cost
  - Compute Lagrangian multiplier
  - Generate budget line data
- Enhanced visualizations:
  - Combined plot of indifference curves and budget line
  - Interactive plots
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Detailed documentation and user guide

## Installation
